# Tensorflow Examples

View my blog posts on neural networks : [https://kusemanohar.wordpress.com/tag/neural-network/](https://kusemanohar.wordpress.com/tag/neural-network/).

Here I am consolidating and upgrading my code to be compatible with tf1.10. In particular, I
am moving all the network construction part to keras. This is just my
tensorflow basic examples.

## How I learned to use Tensorflow
I already had a theoritical understanding of neural networks. I think, the most authentic source is
[Stanford's cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). I just watched all the lectures and implemented
a crude neural network from absolute scratch.

After I had the basic, I started reading papers. There are several lists on the internet
which maintain a list of must read deep learning papers. See [awesome-deep-learning-papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers) for example.

After all this, I got my hands dirty with tensorflow. I started with tf0.6. Tensorflow is continuously
evolving so it is important to read the documentation and/or look at official examples. I think this is best
way to get familiar with standard tricks. Top-end folks out there don't have time to write up
tutorials. You might also have a look at pytorch, it is a pretty neat tool to fireup your neural nets.  
Although I still stick to tensorflow.

Current recommended way is to use keras with tensorflow. Keras defines a pretty intuitive API.
Although a new user may have a very steep learning curve. I followed the tensorflow tutorial which
are too basic (does not expose to lot of real cases tensorflow can be used). After that, can
move onto keras examples.
